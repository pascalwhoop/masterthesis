All latex code is under `src/`. I'm using pdflatex to compile and the whole thing is written in vim. To see the
configuration necessary to replicate the environment, see my [dotfiles](https://github.com/pascalwhoop/dotfiles).
Generally, a `tex-full` installation should suffice to compile the documents.
