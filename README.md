# Thesis Repository

Releases are [available here](https://github.com/pascalwhoop/masterthesis/releases) and represent intermediate releases
until my final hand in in August. 

All latex code is under `src/`. I'm using pdflatex to compile and I write the whole thing in vim. To see the
configuration necessary to replicate the environment, see my [dotfiles](https://github.com/pascalwhoop/dotfiles).
Generally, a `tex-full` installation should suffice to compile the documents. the `compile.sh` script also gives some
more details. 

The graphics are importable with [draw.io](https://draw.io) 


Most code is linked in the thesis but you can also just check out my github profile. `grpc-adapter`, `broker-python`
etc.
