\acl {UL}  suffers one key difference: The set of data that is used to learn from does not include labels or
classifications to learn from. In other words, there are no examples present to know what it is that needs to be
learned. Common examples of unsupervised learning are \emph{clustering} or \emph{principal components analysis}. The
overall goal of \ac {UL} is therefore not to predict but to learn information about the underlying distributions and
reasons as to why the values that have been measured were measured as such. \ac {UL} is also used during pre-processing
data for \ac {SL} problems to improve the later results of the regression or classification problems. 

TODO decide: how deep do I go here?
