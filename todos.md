# TODO Thesis last 3 weeks

## Reviewing
- Send to Peter and Christian
- Get feedback from Lukas
- Let Giorgia read
- what about the printing? call the printing service
- 

## Writing
- discussing the reward functions for RL agents in wholesale?
- moving the reward functions into a separate subchapter
- learning from historical data describing the three stages (bandit arm, discrete preselected actions, continuous
  actions)
- results --> have I answered the research question? No, no success. But I have built a good baseline for future woork. 

## Coding
- try bandit style: agent just learns what price to bid, not how much.
- try some preprocessing variants 
- "walk backwards" from bandit to continuous action space
- try with more input types / preprocess better
- clean up WholesaleObservationSpace vs simply passing the environment (text l 1944 )

- always bidding the same in all market slots? Not normal? "asking for large volumne"

## DONE

- draw.io graphic on wholesale components
